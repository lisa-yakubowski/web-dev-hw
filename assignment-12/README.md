1. My imaginary client is Love and Joy cat rescue. I've rescued animals for years, and have worked with a lot of rescues as well, so this seemed like a natural choice. For a client like this, the needs generally revolve around reliable contact and services offered, but information about the client is often a must as well.

2. display: inline forces elements to act like inline elements without forcing new lines while ignoring width properties. Display: inline-block works much like display: inline, while still forcing elements to the margin and vertical spacing rules. inline-block, due to not forcing width display, is most often used for vertical navigation bars.

3. This was definitely the most challenging assignment so far, but tackling it was a good challenge. I started with my idea for a client, as well as a rough plan for the site. From there I built the main skeleton of the site, and moved on to the navigation bar, which I struggled a little with wrapping my head around. Once I did things went smoothly!
