1. I've encountered a variety of forms online, but the most predominant type I
tend to see is a contact form. Piles of sites have that familiar contact page
with the usual fields, name, email, comment or question. It's one of those usual
forms that I think everyone has seen before.

2. Inputs can vary depending on purpose. Text inputs allow for data entry of text
content, such as a name or email text field. A selection input may offer a selection
from a list, checkboxes, or similar methods, allowing for a selection of preexisting data. Button inputs allow for an action by a button being clicked. This may be to submit data, to move to another page, or andy other number of actions.

3. My work cycle was a little more disjointed on this assignment due to forms.
For some reason I found myself having a harder time with some of the specifics,
so I was looking back on documentation and examples more, including my own "demo"
example that I explored along the way and with the walkthrough. I feel like this
was definitely a more difficult assignment, but I also feel like the challenge was
a good thing, as I kept going through it.
