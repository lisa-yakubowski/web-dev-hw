1. This course taught me an immense amount about web development. I feel like from the start to where I am now has been a bit of a journey when it comes to ability with HTML and CSS. GitHub was also an excellent experience to begin using as a resource.

2. While design was something I had experience in, this course helped clarify it more into terms of the web and usability approaches. I think compatibility and building for an end user are two major take aways from it.

3. For this last site I really found my groove, and it was less "Oh, so now how do I do that?" and a lot more "I know how to do that!". It was an overall great experience and really felt more like being able to show off what I had learned.
