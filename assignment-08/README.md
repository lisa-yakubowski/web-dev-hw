1. For me, much of HTML was new frontier when I started this class, but it has
done an excellent job of not only showing and conveying how to use HTML,
but in  making it fun to use. I've found it an excellent process, and continue
to find myself using HTML much more.

2. CSS seems a little daunting, but I'm excited for the additional styling
capabilities it offers, and look forward to incorporating it into my work.
While HTML has served to offer a great basis to work from, I'll appreciate
the ability to improve the appearance of my sites through CSS.

3. My work flow for this project was very structured, going step by step.
I've found that project setup is very automatic for me at this point, and I've
taken to creating and laying out my files, setting each up, then working on
each, one at a time. I've found this lets me tackle a larger project more
easily, with fewer errors or hiccups.
