## Lisa Yakubowski

I decided to take this class in order to expand my knowledge of web design and the application of coding in the process. I feel it's a beneficial skill to learn, and that by getting hands on experience with it from the ground up that it will be a huge help to me down the road. Websites are a necessity, and by having the skillset in place it means I can apply it in a variety of ways in the future. So far it's a lot of fun!

List:

- I've learned a more detailed idea of what the internet is and isn't.
- I've now learned about using text editors like Atom.
- I've gotten a much better grasp of how directories operate and how they apply.
