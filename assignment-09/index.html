      <p>The Roaring '20s were a time of affluence and excess. While prohibition
        was in full effect, speakeasies provided lively locations where many affluent
        trendsetters would gather to drink, as seen below. These locations were often
      more secluded, despite being popular. Even so, the fashion of the time persisted
    in the locations.</p>

      <p>While personal style was heavy on bright formal wear, beads, and shimmery aspects,
      architecture was heavy on art deco styling, as seen in the image below.</p>
