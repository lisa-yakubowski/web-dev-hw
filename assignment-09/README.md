1. A universal selector is used to apply to every element on a page, and element selector
applies to a specific element type, a class selector applies to all elements calling the class,
and an id selector applies on an id by id basis for individual elements.

2. I chose a more vintage color palette for this project to match the theme
of the Roaring 20s. In my mind Gold, Silver, and Black came to mind, so that's
the palette I chose. The specific color names I opted for are: Khaki, Silver,
and Black.

3. This cycle's workflow was straightforward. I built the main skeleton of the project, as I
immediately decided on the 1920s, and after that was completed I sourced the images I needed
for the style I had in mind.
