1. A system font is one already found on your system/device, such as preinstalled fonts in windows. Web fonts are those hosted on a web server, and do not need to be on the system
that's viewing the website. Web-safe fonts are fonts used online that are on most systems/devices, such as the arial family.

2. Fallback fonts allow a system to default back to a standard and available font should a web font fail to load, be unavailable, or have an issue displaying. This keeps content visible.

3. This project's work cycle was very linear, and almost on autopilot in the main creation. While CSS seemed daunting at first, it's now feeling like a welcome addition for more options and flexibility, which I'm enjoying.
