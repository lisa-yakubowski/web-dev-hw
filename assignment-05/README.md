# Assignment 5
## Lisa Yakubowski

1. A document has one head and one body. These construct the basics of the page document, with the head setting up the page, and the body reflecting the content.

2. Structural markup changes the structure of the page, such as differentiating a header, paragraph, or an ordered list. Semantic markup is more visual, such as bold or italic font.

3. This assignment has helped cement my work cycle into a pattern of sorts. I find myself laying my groundwork, setting up my folders and documents, then elaborating on them and adding content. I'm surprising myself, and even more so, I'm greatly enjoying the work!
