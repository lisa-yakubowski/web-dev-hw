1. divs divide up the page and group content, classes act as styling identifiers,
ids allow components in code to be differentiated and identified, and spans act
as inline equivalents to divs.

2. Alt text is text that is used in place of an image. The primary reason to
use it is for accessibility purposes.

3. My work cycle for this project had an excellent flow. I started with the
core structure of my site, creating the skeleton, then expanded and completed
the site with the media. I found this type of cycle to work very well for me,
and it made for a very clean build without any mistakes off the bat.
