    <h1>About Author</h1>
    <p>Robert Frost, though born in San Francisco, returned to his family's origins by moving back to New England.
    A poet throughout his life, he became well known for his writing locally. His very first poem earned him a $15.00 check,
  but his first book was not published until he was 40. Robert Frost won four Pulitzer Prizes in his life, and is considered
the most famous poet of his time.</p>
